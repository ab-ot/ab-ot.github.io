    \section{Introduction}
    
Propositions are essential to the transmission of information and the expression of thoughts and ideas, and every agent who encounters a proposition has a propositional attitude.
These propositional attitudes are self-explanatory concepts at their most basic level, attitudes toward one or more propositions. 
Concerning ourselves now with propositional attitudes that represent the world, representational attitudes, such as "I believe X" we then see a large number of possibilities for classifying varying attitudes. 
Doxastic attitudes are attitudes concerning belief, of which this paper will discuss at least 3: Classificatory, Comparative, and Quantitative.
The purpose of this paper is to highlight one of the most basic doxastic attitudes—Simple Binarism—utilizing it as a starting point and guide for progressing toward a higher level doxastic attitude that can more accurate the world and it's nuances.

    \section{Simple Binarism}
    
Simple Binarism is a classificatory doxastic attitude, and all that means is that according to Simple Binarism, an agent can only believe, disbelieve, and suspend judgment on a proposition. 
The Simple Binarist, a character introduced in the text is an agent following this doxastic doctrine, they are an agent who recognizes neither comparative attitudes nor quantitative attitudes. 
This agent cannot determine belief based on a certain other proposition: My friend is less confident in a home run occurring than the batter striking out; nor can the agent assign a numerical value to the certainty of their belief: My friend is 90\% confident a home run will not occur. 


    \section{Major Problems}
    
Any given rational agent today is likely not limited to any single doxastic attitude like the Simple Binarist is, utilizing all three doxastic attitudes listed allows agents to describe everyday life in a clear and concise manner.
It will soon be apparent that the Simple Binarist utilizing their sole doxastic attitude will face problems when facing real-world propositions with practical rationality, let alone the intense scrutiny of theoretical rationality and abiding those requirements.


    \subsection{Descriptive inadequacy} 
    
Given that the Simple Binarist has a precise "language" because of their doxastic attitude defining how they view the world, there is a significant loss in the translation when describing an agent's proposition. 
In the following sections we will see that while the Simple Binarist's descriptions are not explicitly false, the binary doxastic attitude does not see the proposition in its entirety. 


    \subsubsection{Practical Rationality}
    
Practical rationality is concerned with practical application; in other words, the relationship between attitudes and actions. 
Consider a case where a healthy individual maintains the belief that in the future they will conceive a child.
This same individual also hold the belief that the next time they roll a 6-sided die that the die will not land on its edge.
This person has more confidence in the latter belief than the former of course, and any given rational agent would determine the same based on the information.
Agents who hold multiple doxastic attitudes can see the difference between those two propositional beliefs, however, the Simple Binarist cannot note any difference nor see the agents seemingly obvious grade in belief. 
One could imagine how troublesome this could be when attempting to describe the world accurately.


    \subsubsection{Theoretical Rationality}
    
Compared to Practical rationality, Theoretical rationality is concerned with attitudes that denote representations and their efficacy of representation. 
Belief Closure and Belief Consistency are tied closer to Theoretical rationality than Practical rationality, as they are offered as requirements for the former. 
Consider another scenario of the same individual mentioned earlier, they maintain the belief that in the future they will conceive a child.
However the individual is then presented with some unfortunate news from their physician indicating that conceiving will be slightly more difficult than normal for X reason. 
The individual after this new information still believes they will have children, however there _must_ be a change in their belief given the new information. 
The Simple Binarist however, views both propositions as the same given that ultimately the agent believes both.  

    \subsection{Normative failings}
    
Binary belief has some normative constraints that the text lists such as Belief Consistency and Belief Closure, the former requires logical consistency from set of propositions for rationality, and the latter constraint requires agent to believe proposition entailed propositions at least equally for rationality to be observed.


    \subsubsection{Preface Paradox}
    
As mentioned earlier, Binary beliefs entail two normative constraints: Belief Consistency and Belief Closure, posed with the Preface Paradox they are challenging to maintain.

    \begin{quote}
    You write a long nonfiction book with many claims in its main
    text, each of which you believe. In the acknowledgments at the
    beginning of the book you write, “I’m sure there are mistakes in
    the main text, for which I take full responsibility.”
    \end{quote}
    
According to the text, authors tend to write such prefaces.
The author's intent in writing such a preface would be considered to be rational.
However, the author's beliefs in the paradox are not logically consistent, countering the Belief Consistency principle.
And given that the author cannot believe each of the claims in the book is true and at the same time apologize for any mistakes in the pretext, this would be a counter to the Belief Closure principle.  
This paradox is an example of how the key normative constraints attributed to the binarism can fail. 


    \section{Bayesian Solutions}
    
As shown, there are serious normative and descriptive difficulties in limiting oneself to Simple Binarism. 
These shortcomings are not unique to just the classificatory doxastic attitude, but rather to utilizing any singular doxastic attitude to describe doxastic life will lead to some sort of packet loss. 
This is where Bayesian epistemology may have some solutions by combining Classificatory and Comparative Doxastic attitudes with the Quantitative Doxastic Attitude. 
The conjunction of the three attitudes allows us to classify the belief state of a set of propositions (Classificatory), then determine the order of confidence between members of the set (Comparative), and finally determining the exact value of confidence between the members of the set (Quantitative).  
The Quantitative doxastic attitude is the key to the Bayesian solution, the numerical values of confidence - credal description is what truly gives the most pertinent information that can be visually utilized. 
However, Bayesianism is not without its potential disadvantages. 
Consider how credal descriptions create complete commensurability when grading a set of potentially unrelated propositions.  
Some Epistemologists hold the position that confidence incommensurability is a feature of rational agents and that agents don't work with numerical credence in their minds. 
However many don't find this too concerning given that Bayesianism can be viewed as another dimension of the same belief structure that Classificatory and Comparative attitudes are a part of.
Only after determining whether or not there is a structure to doxastic attitudes can it be determined whether or not Bayesianism is unrealistic.
